  "description": "The PDF to PDF/A Converter plugin transforms standard Portable Document Format (PDF) files to PDF/A by leveraging the power of the “ghostscript” tool. \nPDF/A is an ISO-standardized version of the Portable Document Format (PDF) specialized for use in the archiving and long-term preservation of electronic documents. \nPDF/A differs from PDF by prohibiting features ill-suited to long-term archiving, such as font linking (as opposed to font embedding) and encryption. \nThe ISO requirements for PDF/A file viewers include colour management guidelines, support for embedded fonts, and a user interface for reading embedded annotations.",
