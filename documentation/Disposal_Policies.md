# Disposal Policies

## Disposal Schedule

Disposal schedules set the minimum requirements for the maintenance, retention or destruction actions to be taken in the existing or future intellectual entities in this repository. A intellectual entity may only be destroyed as part of a disposal process governed by the disposal schedule assigned to that entity. It is the intellectual entityâ€™s disposal schedule that determines how long a record is retained and how it is subsequently disposed of at the end of its retention period.
